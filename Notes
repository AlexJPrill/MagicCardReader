Note with the universe beyond cards the layout on the bottom of the card is extremely different of that of normal cards so we need to find a way to differentiate between the two type of cards
The same can be said about older cards which also have a different layout

Need to fine tune the process for the different raritys
This thing is going to take awhile to get the process down

Wondering if I would be able to pick out the information that I need and have the program find it in a smarter way than what I am currently doing
