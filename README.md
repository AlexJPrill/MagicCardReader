# Magic Card Reader
The goal of this project is to see if I can recreate  Magic the Gathering card scanner apps like Dragon Shield and ManaBox. The project itself is made in python using the Paddle OCR library for reading information from an image of a card and the mysql library for storring data about the users collection that can be moddified at a latter time. In its current state the user interacts with the program by using the command line to tell the program what they would like to do.


# Future Plans
- Improve database schema
- Create some sort of graphical user interface
- Swap database over to duckdb to make easier for individual deployment
- Fully implement feature so that older mtg cards can be recognized
- Implement logging system
